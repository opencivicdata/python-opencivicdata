# Changelog

## 3.4.0 (2024-11-11)

* Add support for Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and Django 4.0, 4.2.
* Drop support for Python 3.7, 3.8 and Django 2.2, 3.0.

## 3.3.1 (2024-05-15)

* Add a --sync flag to the loaddivisions management command, to delete divisions that are in the DB but not the CSV, even if the DB contains the CSV. This flag is relevant if you synchronize with a single CSV.

## 3.4.0 (put the date here, I guess)

* Support Django versions >=4.2

## 3.3.0 (2023-05-08)

* Add last_seen field to database objects
* Pupa now has "pupa clean" CLI command
* Change behavior of loaddivisions management command to do nothing if the DB contains the CSV. This means divisions that are in the DB but not the CSV are not deleted. This makes it easier to load multiple CSVs, but harder to synchronize with a single CSV.

## 3.2.0 (2020-03-26)

* add GinIndex for search (requires migration)
* add 'enrolled' bill status

## 1.0.0 (2017-05-25)

Backwards-incompatible changes:

* This package is renamed to opencivicdata from opencivicdata-divisions and opencivicdata-django.
 This also means it is no longer split into opencivicdata-divisions and opencivicdata-django.  This really shouldn't cause any issues, but you shouldn't be installing opencivicdata-divisions anymore, and doing so explicitly may cause some issues.
* Your requirements.txt or other requirements definition should now use the opencivicdata name exclusively.
* Instead of adding:
    ```'opencivicdata.apps.BaseConfig'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` you'll need to add:
    ```
    'opencivicdata.core.apps.BaseConfig',
    'opencivicdata.legislative.apps.BaseConfig',
    ```
* If you already have models you'll need to run: ```./manage.py migrate --fake-initial`` to skip the initial migrations for the two new apps.

* Add `VoteEvent.bill_action`, allowing linking of VoteEvents to bill actions
